            Starting a garden from scratch may seem daunting! But we've got you covered with tons of great ideas and free garden plans for every type of yard, whether it's big and sprawling or teeny-tiny. For starters, look at the area you want to plant: Does it get full sun, which is 6 or more hours per day? Or maybe it gets only part sun, which is about half that, or full shade.</p>

            <p id="para2">It's also important to be patient because gardens aren't built overnight! They evolve through the years as you learn more about plants you love. And whether you're an experienced gardener or a complete newbie, Mother Nature will continue to throw you some unexpected twists and turns. The bottom line is you're never done learning about plants and your garden. So, embrace the challenges, enjoy the surprises, and read on to discover great garden plants and layout ideas for your own backyard.</p>

                Even if your space is limited, you can grow herbs right outside your door. Assemble a collection of pots and plant the herbs that you use most often, as well as some varieties that are less familiar to you (you may discover a new fave!). Plant both annual and perennial herbs for a good mix year after year.</p>

            <p id="para4">How about perking up that drab Zone 5 to 8 patio or terrace with a sundial and some compact flowering plants? All you have to do is remove a few of the pavers and plant a few sprawling perennials.</p>

            <p id="para5">
                Sometimes the only way to grow is up! Vining plants add interest and also can provide screening and privacy on a deck or patio. Vines in pots work just as well as those planted in beds.</p>

            <p id="para6">Every garden needs roses! And they're not as fussy as you might suspect. New shrub types are hardy and more disease-resistant so they're perfect even for beginners.</p>
